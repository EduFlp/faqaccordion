<--------------------------------------THE CHALLENGE-------------------------------->
 It was hard for me to use some specific things, like the hide/show response, because I had forgotten the way to work with that.
 I've worked with the hide/show before, but it was in the class I took last year. It's been a long time since I've seen this part of the code.
 Another thing that is good to remember is the fact that icons and words need to be next to each other. So, if the user don't know anything about 'space-between', it will problably become harder that it already is.
 Furthermore, it is good to improve my skills and discover new kinds of tags and CSS parameters. By the way, I expect to move on to next level of programming, using more things like a framework or something more sophisticated, like Bootstrap.

 <------------------------------------BUILT WITH----------------------------------->
 - Semantic HTML 5 markup
 - CSS custom properties
 - Flexbox
 - Mobile-First workflow

 <-------------------------------------WHAT I LEARNED------------------------------>
 I learned more about CSS and JavaScript. The way they relato to each other is more independent, as HTML doesn't necessarily have to be in the middle. Additionally, I remembered some old js concepts taht I had never seen again, such as addEventListener and querySelector.

 <-----------------------------------CONTINUED DEVELOPMENT------------------------->
 After this challenge, I am very proud of my knowledge about CSS and HTML. However, I've also noticed that I need some help with js and some CSS parts, like font (CSS) and some commands from js (addEventListener).
 If someone open my code, please, help me with that and give some tips to make code great.
